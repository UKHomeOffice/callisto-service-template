# callisto-service-template
Template for Callisto service projects


# Callisto setup
Within the template you will see 'REPLACE-SERVICE-NAME'. Every occurrence of these needs to be 
replaced with the new service name.

Within application.properties & Dockerfile you will find 'REPLACE-SERVICE-PORT'. This needs to be 
replaced with the port the new service is exposing.
